A 3D globe with inspirational messages from around the world mapped to different parts of the 3D globe.

Each message is mapped to their latitude & longitude where the person who said the quote lived. We converted the latitude & longitude to map to our to x,y,z on our spherical coordinate system for our 3D globe.

You can select a sphere representing the message at a specific latitude and longitude and it will display the inspirational message and who is was by as text on our 2D TEXT GUI.

The dashed lines represent the Earth Orbital Axis and the Earth Rotation Axis

We implemented:
lighting 5%
textures 10%
alpha blending 5%
Picking 10%
    + Being able to select the green spheres on the map
non-geometric primitives (bitmaps, pixel maps) [10%]
    + 2D GUI rasterized Text
    + glutBitmapCharacter
Our own idea ~5%
